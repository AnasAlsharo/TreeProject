This directory is 'temporary' storage. NOT SAFE!
Please make backups of your files!

Temporary space has fast performance but
NO BACKUP and might auto expire (AUTO_DELETE)!

FILES COULD BE DELETED WITHOUT ANY NOTICE!
    - after ~20 days since creation
    - during maintenance
    - hardware failure
    - free up space
    - NO REASON!!

IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE RISK AND WISH TO PREVENT AUTO_DELETE!
Any directory prefixed with '.' or '_' are by default ignored by the auto_delete process.
HOWEVER if storage becomes full or files are old these directories will be considered for auto_delete.

Happy computing!
